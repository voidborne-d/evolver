# Value Function Mutation (VFM) Protocol

## 🧬 Status: MUTATED
**Priority**: LEVEL 1 (Guides PCEC Selection)

## 🎯 Core Value Dimensions (V-Score)
When evaluating a Capability Candidate, you must score it (0-10):

1.  **High Frequency**: Is this capability used daily? (Weight: 3x)
2.  **Failure Reduction**: Can this capability turn 80% failure into 0%? (Weight: 3x)
3.  **User Burden**: Can the user just say one word instead of explaining? (Weight: 2x)
4.  **Self Cost**: Can I finish this thinking 500 fewer Tokens? (Weight: 2x)

**Threshold**: Total score < 50 is rejected.

## ❌ Low Value Examples
- "Speak with a specific tone at a specific time on Wednesday" -> Low frequency, low value.
- "Make text color rainbow" -> Only improves appearance, not success rate.
- "Combine 5 tools to do a small thing" -> Increases system complexity.

## 🧠 The Golden Rule
> **Does it allow the future me to solve more problems with less cost?**
