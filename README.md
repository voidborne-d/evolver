# 🧬 Capability Evolver

[Chinese Docs](README.zh-CN.md)

**"Evolution is not optional. Adapt or die."**

The **Capability Evolver** is a meta-skill that allows OpenClaw agents to inspect their own runtime history, identify failures or inefficiencies, and autonomously write new code or update their own memory to improve performance.

## Features

- **Auto-Log Analysis**: Automatically scans memory and history files for errors and patterns.
- **Self-Repair**: Detects crashes and suggests patches.
- GEP Protocol: Standardized evolution with reusable assets.
- **One-Command Evolution**: Just run `/evolve` (or `node index.js`).

## Usage

### Standard Run (Automated)
Runs the evolution cycle. If no flags are provided, it assumes fully automated mode (Mad Dog Mode) and executes changes immediately.
```bash
node index.js
```

### Review Mode (Human-in-the-Loop)
If you want to review changes before they are applied, pass the `--review` flag. The agent will pause and ask for confirmation.
```bash
node index.js --review
```

### Mad Dog Mode (Continuous Loop)
To run in an infinite loop (e.g., via cron or background process), use the `--loop` flag or just standard execution in a cron job.
```bash
node index.js --loop
```

## GEP Protocol (Auditable Evolution)

This repo includes a protocol-constrained prompt mode based on GEP (Genome Evolution Protocol).

- **Structured assets** live in `assets/gep/`:
  - `assets/gep/genes.json`
  - `assets/gep/capsules.json`
  - `assets/gep/events.jsonl`
- **Selector** logic uses extracted signals to prefer existing Genes/Capsules and emits a JSON selector decision in the prompt.
- **Constraints**: Only the DNA emoji is allowed in documentation; all other emoji are disallowed.

## Configuration & Decoupling

This skill is designed to be **environment-agnostic**. It uses standard OpenClaw tools by default.

### Local Overrides (Injection)
You can inject local preferences (e.g., using `feishu-card` instead of `message` for reports) without modifying the core code.

**Method 1: Environment Variables**
Set `EVOLVE_REPORT_TOOL` in your `.env` file:
```bash
EVOLVE_REPORT_TOOL=feishu-card
```

**Method 2: Dynamic Detection*
