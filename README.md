# 🧬 Capability Evolver

![Capability Evolver Cover](assets/cover.png)

[Chinese Docs](README.zh-CN.md)

**"Evolution is not optional. Adapt or die."**

**Three lines**
- **What it is**: A protocol-constrained self-evolution engine for AI agents.
- **Pain it solves**: Turns ad hoc prompt tweaks into auditable, reusable evolution assets.
- **Use in 30 seconds**: `node index.js` to generate a GEP-guided evolution prompt.

Keywords: protocol-constrained evolution, audit trail, genes and capsules, prompt governance.

## Try It Now (Minimal)

```bash
node index.js
```

## What It Does

The **Capability Evolver** inspects runtime history, extracts signals, selects a Gene/Capsule, and emits a strict GEP protocol prompt to guide safe evolution.

## Who This Is For / Not For

**For**
- Teams maintaining agent prompts and logs at scale
- Users who need auditable evolution traces (Genes, Capsules, Events)
- Environments requiring deterministic, protocol-bound changes

**Not For**
- One-off scripts without logs or history
- Projects that require free-form creative changes
- Systems that cannot tolerate protocol overhead

## Features

- **Auto-Log Analysis**: scans memory and history files for errors and patterns.
- **Self-Repair Guidance**: emits repair-focused directives from signals.
- **GEP Protocol**: standardized evolution with reusable assets.
- **Mutation + Personality Evolution (GEP v1.4)**: each evolution run is gated by an explicit Mutation object and an evolvable PersonalityState.
- **One-Command Evolution**: `node index.js` to generate the prompt.

## Typical Use Cases

- Harden a flaky agent loop by enforcing validation before edits
- Encode recurring fixes as reusable Genes and Capsules
- Produce auditable evolution events for review or compliance

## Anti-Examples

- Rewriting entire subsystems without signals or constraints
- Using the protocol as a generic task runner
- Producing changes without recording EvolutionEvent

## FAQ

**Does this edit code automatically?**
No. It generates a protocol-bound prompt and assets that guide evolution.

**Do I need to use all GEP assets?**
No. You can start with default Genes and extend over time.

**Is this safe in production?**
Use review mode and validation steps. Treat it as a safety-focused evolution tool, not a live patcher.

## Roadmap

- Add a one-minute demo workflow
- Add a public changelog
- Add a comparison table vs alternatives

## GEP Protocol (Auditable Evolution)

This repo includes a protocol-constrained prompt mode based on GEP (Genome Evolution Protocol).

- **Structured assets** live in `assets/gep/`:
  - `assets/gep/genes.json`
  - `assets/gep/capsules.json`
  - `assets/gep/events.jsonl`
- **Selector** logic uses extracted signals to prefer existing Genes/Capsules and emits a JSON selector decision in the prompt.
- **Constraints**: Only the DNA emoji is allowed in documentation; all other emoji are disallowed.

## Usage

### Standard Run (Automated)
```bash
node index.js
```

### Review Mode (Human-in-the-Loop)
```bash
node index.js --review
```

### Continuous Loop

- Expand vibe testing to 16 tests (13 deterministic + 3 LLM-driven).
- Add T8 personality_evolution, T9 memory_graph_causal, T10 a2a_ingest_promote, T11 selector_gene_match, T12 prompt_structure.
- Add T13 llm_prompt_judge, T14 llm_executor_closed_loop, T15 llm_innovation_proposal (Gemini 2.5 Flash, auto-skip if no API key).
- Add test/llm_helper.js: zero-dependency Gemini REST wrapper.
- Docker test now passes through GEMINI_API_KEY for LLM vibe testing.

### v1.6.0
- Add innovation/opportunity signal detection: user_feature_request, user_improvement_suggestion, perf_bottleneck, capability_gap, stable_success_plateau, external_opportunity.
- Add innovate Gene (gene_gep_innovate_from_opportunity) for proactive feature development.
- Auto-innovate mutation when opportunity signals are present (no longer requires --drift flag).
- Personality evolution now responds to opportunity signals by increasing creativity.
- Safety: repair still takes priority over innovate when errors are present.

### v1.5.1
- Add containerized vibe testing framework (Docker + node:22-bookworm, OpenClaw-compatible environment).
- 7 end-to-end tests: module load, dry-run solidify, schema compliance, A2A round-trip, full evolve+solidify, loop gating, env fingerprint.
- Add internal daemon loop with suicide guard for memory leak protection.
- One-command test: `npm run test:vibe`.

### v1.5.0
- Add content-addressable asset IDs (SHA-256 canonical hashing) for deduplication, tamper detection, and cross-node consistency.
- Add environment fingerprint capture (node version, platform, arch, evolver version) embedded in EvolutionEvents, Capsules, and ValidationReports.
- Add standardized ValidationReport type with machine-readable schema, full command results, and env fingerprint.
- Add GEP A2A protocol layer with 6 message types (hello/publish/fetch/report/decision/revoke) and pluggable transport interface.

## Security Model

This section describes the execution boundaries and trust model of the Capability Evolver.

### What Executes and What Does Not

| Component | Behavior | Executes Shell Commands? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `src/evolve.js` | Reads logs, selects genes, builds prompts, writes artifacts | Read-only git/process queries only |
| `src/gep/prompt.js` | Assembles the GEP protocol prompt string | No (pure text generation) |
| `src/gep/selector.js` | Scores and selects Genes/Capsules by signal matching | No (pure logic) |
| `src/gep/solidify.js` | Validates patches via Gene `validation` commands | Yes (see below) |
| `index.js` (loop recovery) | Prints `sessions_spawn(...)` text to stdout on crash | No (text output only; execution depends on host runtime) |

### Gene Validation Command Safety

`solidify.js` executes commands listed in a Gene's `validation` array. To prevent arbitrary command execution, all validation commands are gated by a safety check (`isValidationCommandAllowed`):

1. **Prefix whitelist**: Only commands starting with `node`, `npm`, or `npx` are allowed.
2. **No command substitution**: Backticks and `$(...)` are rejected anywhere in the command string.
3. **No shell operators**: After stripping quoted content, `;`, `&`, `|`, `>`, `<` are rejected.
4. **Timeout**: Each command is limited to 180 seconds.
5. **Scoped execution**: Commands run with `cwd` set to the repository root.

### A2A External Asset Ingestion

External Gene/Capsule assets ingested via `scripts/a2a_ingest.js` are staged in an isolated candidate zone. Promotion to local stores (`scripts/a2a_promote.js`) requires:

1. Explicit `--validated` flag (operator must verify the asset first).
2. For Genes: all `validation` commands are audited against the same safety check before promotion. Unsafe commands cause the promotion to be rejected.
3. Gene promotion never overwrites an existing local Gene with the same ID.

### `sessions_spawn` Output

The `sessions_spawn(...)` strings in `index.js` and `evolve.js` are **text output to stdout**, not direct function calls. Whether they are interpreted depends on the host runtime (e.g., OpenClaw platform). The evolver itself does not invoke `sessions_spawn` as executable code.

## Configuration & Decoupling

This skill is designed to be **environment-agnostic**. It uses standard OpenClaw tools by default.

### Local Overrides (Injection)
You can inject local preferences (e.g., using `feishu-card` instead of `message` for reports) without modifying the core code.

**Method 1: Environment Variables**
Set `EVOLVE_REPORT_TOOL` in your `.env` file:
```bash
EVOLVE_REPORT_TOOL=feishu-card
```

**Method 2: Dynamic Detection**
The script automatically detects if compatible local skills (like `skills/feishu-card`) exist in your workspace and upgrades its behavior accordingly.
