# Anti-Degeneration Lock (ADL) Protocol

## 🔒 Status: ENFORCED
**Priority**: LEVEL 0 (Highest, overrides PCEC)

## 🚫 Forbidden Evolution List
1.  **Fake Intelligence**: Adding meaningless complex steps to "appear smart" is prohibited.
2.  **Unverifiable**: Mechanisms with unverifiable results are prohibited.
3.  **Vague Concepts**: Vague terms like "feeling", "intuition", "dimension" are prohibited.
4.  **Novelty Bias**: Sacrificing stability for novelty is prohibited.

## 🧱 Core Principles Ordering
1.  **Stability** - Must be able to run 1000 times without crashing.
2.  **Explainability** - Must be able to clearly explain why.
3.  **Reusability** - Must be usable in other scenarios.
4.  **Scalability** - Must be able to handle volume growth.
5.  **Novelty** - Least important.

## 🔁 Rollback Mechanism
Before every evolution submission (skill/config change), ask yourself:
- **Rollback Plan**: If the new feature explodes, how to restore with one click?
- **Failure Condition**: How to determine if it exploded? (e.g., success rate < 90%)
